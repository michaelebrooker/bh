## Your stay at Buhooro

There are five staff permanently on site, and **Alfred** our guard keeps the place secure, with **Nama** running the house and supervising guests. All our staff are friendly and welcoming.

The main part of the bungalow is open plan with kitchen-dining area and lounge combined, and the French windows look out over **Lake Victoria**. You can sit and take tea with the afternoon on-shore breeze cooling, either in the lounge or on the verandah.

The verandah looks out over the beach and **Lake Victoria,** and is in front of the living area and two of the bedrooms have French windows with views of the Lake.

There are three bedrooms: the master bedroom - above - has a private en-suite shower and toilet and French windows looking out to the Lake. The other two bedrooms have shared shower and toilet facilities. Every bedroom has a modern double bed. At night you can hear the waves lapping on the shore lulling you to sleep.

**Above: bedroom three** has a double bed and shared shower and toilet. 

Otherwise, facilities are fairly simple, as there is no television, but good connectivity via mobile data, allows us to keep connected worldwide. Apart from the lack of television, we are connected to mains electricity and have a modern kitchen with a refridgerator, toaster etc.  


{{< responsive-image img="/images/eggs.jpg/" text="Fresh eggs from our chickens." >}}

We have fresh eggs from local chickens which are excellent, and the little fishing village is a short walk, and has small stalls selling vegetables and fruit, as well as freshly-caught fish. 

{{< responsive-image img="/images/pusska.jpg/" text="Pusska our cat." >}}

Pusska is friendly to all and too spoiled and well-fed to bother with catching her own lunch. 
We also have two Alsatians, which are also very friendly.
