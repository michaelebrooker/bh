### Make Buhooro your base camp to explore Uganda

Both Entebbe and Kampala are a short drive from Buhooro. The Express Highway can take you all the way to Munyonyo and Ggaba in South Kampala. 

Kampala has a buzzing nightlife and many bars and restaurants. 

Entebbe has beautiful lakeside beach resorts and historic buildings as well as the Botanical Gardens which also hosts a very varied wildlife. 

From Kampala, you can travel out of the capital to Jinja, and to Soroti in the north, as well as Mbarara and Kisoro in the westerly direction. Coaches as well as minibuses - called Mutatus â€“ ply these routes daily.
